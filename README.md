# meraIRCTC2020

This Project is called MeraIRCTC2020, which is basically a JavaFX application that is responsible for providing Railways(Indian) related services to the user. The user can create their account after which they can avail the services that are being provided by us like:

1. PNR check  (Currently unavailable due to COVID enforced lockdown)
2. Train Information 
3. Station Information 
(More features will be added soon)

Once logged in, the user will get to have the access to the user Dashboard, where all the inportant user related informations will be displayed along with the options to avail our services. Once a user understakes / uses a particular service, the search information gets stored and afterwhich when the user again comes back to use the same service, the previous search information will be displayed to the user, for his further reference( if he needs any). 

More improvements are to be added with time.

Technologies used:

1. Java 
2. JavaFX
3. Indian railways API
4. MySQL database for storage of data. (Which later can be exported to AWS if the application is made available for public)
